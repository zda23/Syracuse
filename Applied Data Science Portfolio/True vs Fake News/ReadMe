The presentation on Fake News Detection, prepared by Zane Alderfer, James Burrows, Monica Fam, and Sandy Leung, explores the application of various machine learning and deep learning models to 
identify and classify fake news. The study utilized two datasets of true and fake news articles, performing extensive preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to prepare the data for modeling. 
Sentiment analysis was conducted to understand the emotional manipulation in fake news. The team employed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), logistic regression, random 
forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to develop predictive models. Each model demonstrated high accuracy, with CNN achieving around 99.84% accuracy and RNN reaching approximately 92.46%. 
The DistilBERT model, a smaller and faster variant of BERT, was also tested and showed strong performance but raised concerns about overfitting. The study concluded that while deep learning models 
are effective in detecting fake news, they may be prone to overfitting and require careful computational resource management. Additionally, traditional machine learning models tended to classify a 
high proportion of news as fake, indicating the need for further refinement and balance in prediction accuracy.
