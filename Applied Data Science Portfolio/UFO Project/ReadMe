The final report for the IST 718 project, titled "Data Encounters of the Third Kind: Unraveling the UFO Phenomenon" by Zane Alderfer, Ben Heindl, and Victoria Haley, presents an in-depth analysis 
of UFO sighting data to investigate potential extraterrestrial activities or atmospheric phenomena. Utilizing various analytical techniques, including spatial, temporal, shape-related, textual, and 
demographic analyses, the study aimed to uncover patterns and trends in the data. Key findings revealed geographical hotspots, temporal fluctuations, common UFO shapes, and mostly positive sentiments 
in sighting reports. Demographic analysis showed weak correlations with socioeconomic variables, while spatial proximity analysis highlighted a significant association between UFO sightings and proximity 
to major airports. The report underscores the complexity of UFO phenomena, influenced by multiple factors, and recommends continued research, improved data quality, public education, multidisciplinary 
approaches, enhanced reporting practices, and mitigation of misidentifications to advance understanding and promote informed public discourse.
