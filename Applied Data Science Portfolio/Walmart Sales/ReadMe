The "Sales Risk Mitigation" presentation, prepared by Megan Zane, Nick, and Zane Alderfer, provides a comprehensive analysis of three years of weekly sales data for 45 stores to protect 
profitability through data analytics. The pilot team evaluated the impact of temperature on sales and found no significant correlation between average yearly temperatures and store sales. 
The analysis identified the highest and lowest performing departments in various weather conditions, highlighting that temperature did not significantly affect overall sales performance. 
The team also explored the influence of CPI, unemployment, and fuel prices on weekly sales through multi-variable regression, concluding that these variables were significant but did not fully 
explain the sales model. Recommendations for Phase 2 include integrating geographic data, extreme weather impacts, and marketing campaigns into the analysis, enhancing the dashboard for dynamic
  multivariate analysis, and continuing to refine data transformations and modeling techniques.
